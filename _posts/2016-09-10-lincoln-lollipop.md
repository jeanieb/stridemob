Join us for 4.1 or 8.3 miles of trail at the Lincoln Lollipop Run on Saturday September 10, 2016 at [Lincoln Mountain Open Space](http://www.douglas.co.us/dcoutdoors/openspace-properties/lincoln-mountain-open-space/) in Larkspur, CO. Come race Douglas County's newest open space. From open trail to shaded beauty, this trail has it all. You begin in open prairie and continue to a rocky forested trail. The loop winds you through gamble oak to ponderosa pine with a break taking view of Pike's Peak on your run into the finish line. Run the 4.1 mile loop or tackle the 8.3 mile run, which adds 400 feet of climbing to experience magnificent panoramic views.
