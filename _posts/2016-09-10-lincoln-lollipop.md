The Lincoln Lollipop is back! At [Lincoln Mountain Open Space and Trails](http://www.douglas.co.us/dcoutdoors/openspace-properties/lincoln-mountain-open-space/), this lollipop loop race begins in open prairie and takes you onto forested rocky trails. This loop winds through gambel oak and ponderosa pine with a breathtaking view of Pike's Peak on your return to the finish line.
