BENEFITING NON-PROFIT
All proceeds from the Miles for Tuesday 5K run/walk will go directly to The Pablove Foundation whose mission is to invest in underfunded, cutting-edge pediatric cancer research, inspire cancer families through education, and improve the lives of children living with cancer through the arts. Specifically, proceeds from the 5K event will help to fund The Pablove Foundation’s Denver Shutterbugs program – a program that teaches children in Colorado living with cancer to develop their creative voice through the art of photography.

The Miles for Tuesday 5K is named in honor of Tuesday Whitt from Castle Rock, CO who lost her battle to childhood cancer at the age of 2. Since 2009, Miles for Tuesday related events have raised over $190,000 in support of children living with cancer here in Colorado.
