Join StrideMob in Castle Rock January 2nd for the Resolution Run and make a commitment to stay active this winter. This 5k downtown will take you out and back along the Plum Creek Trail. Your run will finish at Festival Park where the town’s [Winterfest](http://www.crgov.com/2531/Season-of-the-Star) festivities will be kicking off. Castle Rock is where families thrive. Let’s resolve to make 2016 an active year!

Thanks to everyone who came out and started 2016 with us!
