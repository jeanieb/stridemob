Join StrideMob in Castle Rock January 2nd for the Resolution Run and make a commitment to stay active this winter. This 5k downtown will take you out and back along the Plum Creek Trail. Your run will finish at Festival Park where the town’s [Winterfest](http://visitcastlerock.org/event/season-star-winterfest/) festivities will be kicking off. Castle Rock is where families thrive. Let’s resolve to make 2016 an active year!
