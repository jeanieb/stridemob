[Lincoln Mountain Open Space and Trails](http://www.douglas.co.us/dcoutdoors/openspace-properties/lincoln-mountain-open-space/) is one of Douglas County's newest parks. From open trail to shaded beauty, this 4.5 mile trail run won't disappoint you. After a year in the works, StrideMob had an unbelievably successful first event, the Lincoln Lollipop Trail Run. We can't say enough thanks to all of our sponsors, friends and family, and all of you amazing runners that got up Saturday morning to run with us! Please know that our smiles this morning are still because of your support and kindness!

This lollipop loop race begins in open prairie and takes you onto forested rocky trails. This loop winds through gambel oak and ponderosa pine with a breathtaking view of Pike's Peak on your return to the finish line.
